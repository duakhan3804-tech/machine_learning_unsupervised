Taxi Fare Prediction Model
This repository contains a trained machine-learning model for predicting taxi fare prices based on ride features such as distance, duration, and passenger count.
The model is exported as a .pkl file so it can be easily integrated into applications and APIs.

Model Details..........................................
Model Type: Regression
Input: Numeric ride features (distance, time, passengers, etc.)
Output: Estimated fare price
Format: .pkl (Pickle)
Environment: Python 3.x

Project Description.......................................
Taxi Fare Prediction is a regression-based machine-learning project that estimates the cost of a taxi ride based on ride features such as:
Distance traveled
Ride duration
Passenger count
The goal is to predict the fare accurately using regression algorithms and proper data preprocessing.

Project Overview........................................
The Taxi Fare Prediction Model is built using machine-learning regression techniques. It takes numerical ride information as input and outputs an estimated fare.
This model can be used in:
Streamlit apps
Flask / FastAPI backends
Jupyter Notebook experiments
Mobile/desktop applications (via API).

Libraries Used.............................................
NumPy – for numerical operations
Pandas – dataset handling
Scikit-learn – machine learning
(Regression models........)
Train-test split
Preprocessing tools
Model evaluation metrics
Pickle – saving the trained model


Requirements-----------------------Install dependencies:
(pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn)
